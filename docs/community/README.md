## Apache Submarine Community

Welcome to the Apache Submarine Community! The main objective is to help members of the Submarine community who share similar interests to learn from and collaborate with each other.

Your journey of becoming a contributor and committer starts from here: improving docs, improving code, giving talks, organizing meetups, etc.

## Communicating

You can reach out to the community members via any one of the following ways: 

+ Slack Developer: [https://the-asf.slack.com/submarine-dev/](https://the-asf.slack.com/submarine-dev/)

+ Slack User: [https://the-asf.slack.com/submarine-user/](https://the-asf.slack.com/submarine-user/)

## Your First Contribution

You can start by finding an existing issue with the [https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SUBMARINE/issues/SUBMARINE?filter=allopenissues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SUBMARINE/issues/SUBMARINE?filter=allopenissues) label. These issues are well suited for new contributors. 

If a PR (Pull Request) submitted to the [Submarine Github](https://github.com/apache/submarine) projects by you is approved and merged, then you become a Submarine Contributor. 

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.

2. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.

3. Submit a [pull request of Submarine](https://github.com/apache/submarine) containing a tested change. 

Once you become a contributor of Apache Submarine, check your name here: [CONTRIBUTORS](contributors.md)

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](contributing.md) for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.
