## Introduction

* The test cases under the directory `test-k8s` are integration tests to ensure the correctness of the Submarine RESTful API.

* You can run these tests either locally or on GitHub Actions.
  * Before running the tests, the minikube (KinD) cluster must be created. 
  * Then, compile and package the submarine project in `submarine-dist` directory for building a docker image. 
  * In addition, the 8080 port in submarine-traefik should be forwarded.

## Run k8s test locally

1. Ensure you have setup the KinD cluster or minikube cluster. If you haven't, follow this [`minikube tutorial`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

2. Build the submarine from source and upgrade the server pod through this [`guide`](./Development/#build-from-source)

3. Forward port
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 service/submarine-traefik 8080:80
    ```
4. Install the latest package "submarine-server-core" into the local repository, for use as a dependency in the module `test-k8s`
    ```bash
    mvn install -DskipTests
    ```

5. Execute the test command
    ```bash
    mvn verify -DskipRat -pl :submarine-test-k8s -Phadoop-2.9 -B
    ```

## Run k8s test in GitHub Actions
* Each time a code is submitted, GitHub Actions is triggered automatically.
